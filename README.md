This Project is developed based on reference Bob Webster's project **[RulesSDK](https://github.com/rdbwebster/RulesSDK)** and **[Car Rental Sample Application](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36909_01/user.1111/e10228/decision_point.htm#CHDJJDEB)**.

In my project I have added couple of functionality.

 1. Create a Dictionary
 2. Create a Decision Function
 

As of now this is complete executable code in Jdevloper 11.1.1.7 ide environment. No need to add any external jars. All libraries are with reference to Jdeveloper. 

Thanks.
